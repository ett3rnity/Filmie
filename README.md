 Mobile Development android-app-development
 My goal was to create application to check information about latest/interesting films. Also I`ve implemented some additional features, such as search of film/tv-show/actor. You can add films you liked into database,so you can reach them even you`re out of  the network. Application is multilingual.
 I built this native app on Java into Android Studio with such stack of technologies: Retrofit, SQLite, ButterKnife.
